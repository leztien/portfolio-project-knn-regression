# KNN Regression

Use protein and peptide data measurements from Parkinson's disease patients to predict doctor's assessment of a patient's state.

The data used in this project is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amp-parkinsons-disease-progression-prediction)

This is my intermediary project at the [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/en/bootcamp/data-science) **Data Science bootcamp**.

Some details:
- type: regression
- ML model: KNN
- model utility metric: (adjusted) SMAPE _(symmetric mean absolute percentage error)_
- SMAPE: 34% _(the lower the better)_
- RMSE = 7.135 _(target range: 0 - 52)_

A live demo of the model is available as a Streamlit app
